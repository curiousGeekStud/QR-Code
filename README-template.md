## My process
  HTML:
    An outer container (outer-box) holds two sections: one for the image (image-box) and one for the text (text-box).

  CSS:
    The body uses Flexbox to center the container on the screen, both vertically and horizontally.
    Inside the container, the image and text are stacked vertically and aligned to the center.
    The design is responsive, with flexible widths for smaller screens and a maximum width for larger screens.
    Added padding, rounded corners, and a shadow to make the box look clean and modern.
    The image size is controlled to prevent it from getting too large.

  ### Built with
  - Semantic HTML5 markup
  - CSS
  - Flexbox

  ### What I learned

  Effective Use of Flexbox:
    Implementing Flexbox properties like justify-content and align-items facilitates precise alignment and centering of elements within containers.

  Responsive Design Principles:
    Utilizing relative units (e.g., percentages) and setting maximum widths ensures that components adapt seamlessly across various screen sizes.

  CSS Styling Enhancements:
    Incorporating properties such as box-shadow and border-radius adds depth and smoothness to elements, contributing to a modern and polished appearance.

  HTML Structure and Semantics:
    Organizing content into semantic containers, like separating images and text into distinct <div> elements, promotes clarity and maintainability in the codebase.
